The 'main.py' script will create the collections
collections are defined in:
- collections.yml
- collections.d/*


The 'Posters\plex_collections.py' is the original script that can update posters and summary and download images from TMDB.

The 'Posters\plex_collections_v2.py' will update the image poster for the collections.
This is my version that only update the poster images and checks for the images from a single folder instead of looking for images on each movie from collection.
Check it's own INSTRUCTIONS inside 'Posters' folder
