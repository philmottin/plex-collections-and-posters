poster images for the collections need to be inside each corresponding library id-name:
ex:
imgs/3-Movies/pictures here
igms/1-Series/pictures here

// 3 is plex library ID and Movies is the exact name of the library
// 1 is plex library ID and |Series is the exact name of the library

posters can be .jpg / .jpeg / .png
posters must match the the collection name.
if posters images name contain the word 'Collection', it's fine, it will be ignored.
